            <h1>Exercise API</h1>
            <div class="text-container">
                <h2>The Free Exercise API</h2>
                <p>
                    After finding a lack of free easy-to-use resources for finding and creating exercises,
                    I decided to create this API to hopefully make it easier for others.
                    <br>
                    This is by no means a finished project, but I am working on making it as functional as
                    possible.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application has a few parts:
                    <dl>
                        <dt>The Exercise Database</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A searchable interface to look up various exercise and get reference videos and more.
                            Add in exercises that you can't find and even create a list of exercises to download.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>The Workout Log</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A minimalistic workout logging app to help you log your workouts undisturbed.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>The API</dt>
                        <dd>
                            More geared towards integrations with other applications. It will offer almost all of
                            features above, just through an interface that can be used to access the data from
                            other applications. Documentation to come.
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                </p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
                <h2>Workout Log</h2>
                <p>
                    Currenly in beta, I am also working on making a minimalist workout logger app that can assist
                    people in logging their workouts. This logger is based off of the idea of being as simple as
                    possible, but presented in a UI that's somewhat easier than an notebook or an Excel sheet.
                </p>
                <a href="/log">Workout Log</a>
            </div>
        </main>
    </body>
