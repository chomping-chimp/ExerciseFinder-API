                <h2>The Free Exercise API</h2>
                <p>After finding a lack of free easy-to-use resources for finding and creating exercises,
                    I decided to create this API so that I could offer a free and easily-accessible exercise
                    API that could hopefully help some of those that experienced the same problems that I came across.
                    <br>
                    This is by no means a finished project, but I am working on making it as functional as
                    possible.
                    <br>
                    This project is split in two parts, there is the API and the is the index. The API is more geared
                    to interact with other applications requesting data, it will return data in JSON format, and will
                    require certain query parameters in order to properly get the data intended. The Index is more for 
                    those that would like to browse through the exercises and deal with a familiar interface.
